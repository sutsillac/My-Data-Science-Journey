HiCi Case Study 

HiCi Ltd is a local food export company. HiCi Ltd is expanding to the European

by the EU Food Safety Standard Agency. HiCi Ltd needs to overcome various regulatory 
hurdles to be able to penetrate the EU market. The hurdles are border rejection, and 
mass destruction of substandard product. You have been employed by HiCi Ltd as a Data 
Analyst and provided with raw data from EU Food Safety Standard Agency Portal to help

b. The most rejected food

c. The country of origin of the most rejected food?

d. The most action taken against food exported to the EU?

e. The most reported origin (country) food export?

You are to provide a comprehensive report on the above determinants. To prepare the 
report, you need to visualize the data, create a pivot table of food exported to the EU.
Which of the food products are at the highest risk? What are the risks? 
Which food products would you suggest to the management of HiCi Ltd to focus on
