This is my first repository to track my development as I transition into data science field.



## Project 1: 
EMPLOYEE ATTRITION CONTROL

CASE STUDY
The project is to help a company which is trying to control attrition. There are two sets of data: "Existing employees" and "Employees who have left". Following attributes are available for every employee;
-Satisfaction Level
-Last evaluation
-Number of projects
-Average monthly hours
-Time spent at the company
-Whether they have had a work accident
-Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
-Departments (column sales)

Use your analytics skills to answer the following questions :
1. What type of employees are leaving?
2. Which employees are prone to leave next.
3. Recommendations
